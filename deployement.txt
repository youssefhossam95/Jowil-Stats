*The main steps are covered in this tutorial:
https://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-tutorial/part7/

*Extra info:
-folder data is the editable part of the 
application resources so it's added to the dist folder and is referenced in the build.xml file inside the "<fx:resources id="appRes">" tag
inorder to be shipped externaly with the application. This means that the data folder is placed next to the application jar when deployed.
The real resources folder cannot be edited so this folder is used in deployement instead. 

-The data folder must not contain any files that have arabic names or otherwise an IO exception will be thrown by innosetup during build.

-The project name must not contain spaces to avoid exceptions in innosetup.

-packages/windows folder contains the icons required by inno setup.
